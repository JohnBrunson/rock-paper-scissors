# Rock-Paper-Scissors with statistics

## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

This is meant to be a simple Rock Paper Scissors game with simple input, output, and statistic tracking. I'm hoping to experiment with writing files to local storage since this is something I have not done before. This is, as is much of anything else lately, a work in progress.

This readme is also a bit of a stub. What I've learned so far:

- Easy way to keep statistics is with an object.
- It's also easy enough to compare to the standard library with the includes method to see if there's anything in your array. If it's not there, then it's possible to toss an error.
- I'm thinking it's possible to spit that stats file out to local storage, but I'll need to see what the "best" way to do that is. This, of course, opens more choices. Should the user's file be pulled back in? What data should be logged to a future high score table? And so on... Decisions, decisions.
